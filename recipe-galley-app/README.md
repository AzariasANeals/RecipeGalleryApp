Description:
    I had done a similar assignment in a previous class, so I based my code off of 
    that. It was a little easier because previously I had moving components (to swipe through the images), but this time I just had them listed out.

    The CSS is fairly simple, I wanted something that looked neat and clean. I liked the Libre Baskerville font because it feels "elegant". I also wanted there to be
    a yellow border around it so that it looks like a "art frame".
